## System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript enabled
- Local storage access for saving sessions
- PDF viewer for viewing generated quotes

## Data Persistence

PRISMA uses the browser's localStorage to automatically save your work. This provides:

- Automatic session recovery
- Protection against data loss
- The ability to work on multiple quotes

You can also export quotes to .prisma files for backup or sharing with colleagues.

## Energy Production Integration

PRISMA can integrate with PVGIS (Photovoltaic Geographical Information System) data:

1. Generate a system configuration in PVGIS
2. Export the JSON data from PVGIS
3. Import the JSON into PRISMA
4. Accurate production data will be used in calculations and reports

## Customizing the Interface

The tool offers various customization options:

- Client-specific introduction text
- Custom notes for special conditions
- Upload system renderings for visual documentation
- Adjustable quote validity period

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Data not saving automatically**
- Ensure your browser has localStorage enabled
- Check if you're in private/incognito browsing mode
- Try clearing browser cache

**Issue: Components missing or prices outdated**
- Check for newer versions of PRISMA
- Manually update component prices in the code

**Issue: Quote generation problems**
- Try clearing the cache using the "Clean Cache" button
- Ensure all required fields are completed
- Check that your browser supports Blob URLs

## For Developers

The application is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key technical aspects:

- Component data stored in HTML select elements
- Dynamic DOM manipulation for interface elements
- Blob URLs for document generation
- Local storage API for persistence
- JSON-based file format for exports

To modify the component database, locate the relevant select elements in the HTML code and update the options with new product information.
